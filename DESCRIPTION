Description:  Creates descriptive summaries of datasets. The main focus is to
  provide functionality that automatically mask person-sensitive data, a 
  non-trivial task that should be done programmatically. In contrast to other
  packages, eg the excellent `gtsummary` package, this package does not aim
  to provide presentation-ready tables, but instead focuses on keeping things
  simple by relying only on the `data.table` package for efficient 
  summarization. The summarized data is returned as a simple data.table and the
  user can then prettify the table themselves using eg the `gt` or `flextable`
  packages.
